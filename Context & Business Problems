## Context

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 31% of all deaths (approximately 17.9 million lives each year).

## Key Facts:
- Four out of five CVD deaths are caused by heart attacks and strokes.
- One-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under the age of 70.
- Early detection and management of risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and lifestyle habits are crucial to reducing CVD-related deaths.
- This dataset contains 11 features that can be used to analyze and predict heart disease. The features include demographics, vital signs, and key lifestyle 
indicators. Through SQL analysis, we aim to uncover trends and     provide insights to support early detection and management of cardiovascular risks.

## Business Problems:

### 1. Predictive Insights: Identifying High-Risk Groups
- **Goal:** Analyze age and sex to identify groups with the highest prevalence of heart disease.
- **Purpose:** Help healthcare providers target at-risk demographics for preventative care and early intervention.
Correlation Between Lifestyle Factors and Heart Disease

### 2. Correlation Between Lifestyle Factors and Heart Disease
- **Goal:** Examine how factors such as cholesterol, resting blood pressure, and exercise-induced angina correlate with heart disease outcomes.
- **Purpose:** Provide insights into lifestyle or physiological factors contributing to heart disease risk, enabling data-driven public health strategies.

### 3. Chest Pain Type as an Indicator of Heart Disease
- **Goal:** Analyze the distribution of chest pain types and their association with heart disease.
- **Purpose:** Determine whether specific chest pain types can be used as diagnostic indicators for heart disease.

### 4. Threshold Analysis for Risk Factors
- **Goal:** Identify critical thresholds for cholesterol, blood pressure, and maximum heart rate (MaxHR) that are most commonly associated with heart disease.
- **Purpose:** Establish actionable metrics for healthcare professionals to monitor and manage heart health effectively.
